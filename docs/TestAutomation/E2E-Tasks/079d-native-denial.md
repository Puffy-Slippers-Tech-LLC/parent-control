# 079d — Observe native launch denial without a prior window

Estimate: 20–30 minutes. Aim for one session; this is not a stop timer.
Follow the [session contract](../E2E-Execution-Plan.md#task-size-and-order).

## Scope and prerequisites

Deliver **APP02 and FLOW08 native grid/command blocked-launch results**. Named consumer: task **079a** and any
complete cases released directly by this slice in the canonical queue.

Required tasks (queue IDs; use delivered scope, not predecessor briefs):

- **079** — PARENT16 and FLOW03 public app-policy editing.
- **047** — APP04; FLOW08 native usable-app scope.
- **044** — DESK09; FLOW15 and FLOW01 retained scopes.

## Read only this context

Read only the delivered block rows and their named callables in the
[catalogue](../E2E-Building-Blocks.md), the selected consumer's recipe clauses,
and the affected safety/adapter tests. Follow the
[scoped reading rules](../E2E-Execution-Plan.md#load-only-the-selected-context).
Use delivered prerequisite scopes; do not open predecessor briefs.

## Implementation

Bind usable, hidden-grid and explicit command-denial observations under publicly saved Allowed/Hard/Soft choices. A hidden grid result requires its separately declared command-denial witness.

Keep repository-owned targets addressed by public automation IDs. External
provider bindings use the approved scoped adapter and its ownership, ambiguity,
freshness and uncertain-input guards. Reuse the existing attempt envelope,
observer and worker; add no independent runner or fixture framework.

## Live VM acceptance

In fresh VM attempts with no earlier target window, save each declared access choice and observe native grid/command results, including an unaffected allowed target. Qualify independent valid entry; incomplete absence cannot pass.

Use a fresh guarded VM attempt through shared watchvm intent, display and
command transport. Pass affected cleanup/ownership regressions in isolation
first. Require independent valid entry, wrong-entry refusal, public results,
sanitized collection and owned cleanup. Secret and shared infrastructure changes
retain all applicable regression requirements from the master.

Implement and register this fixed argument-free qualification, with its cleanup
coverage, before invoking it:

```sh
tools/run-tests integration check_e2e_native_denial
```

The selector is planned, not currently qualified. Host checks alone cannot
complete this slice, and it supplies no complete-scenario acceptance credit.

## Close out

Follow the [master close-out](../E2E-Execution-Plan.md#completion-and-document-cleanup).
Record only the actual callable and qualified slice in the catalogue. After
acceptance and cleanup pass, check **079d**, advance the sole pointer to the
following unchecked row and delete this brief after enduring context is in
source/contracts. Keep any unmet gate and its return condition on this task;
do not advance around it.
