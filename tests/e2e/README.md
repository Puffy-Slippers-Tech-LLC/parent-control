# E2E inventory and runner contract

`scenarios.json` is the versioned starting inventory for
[E2E coverage](../../docs/TestAutomation/E2E-Coverage.md). All 156 variants are
currently **pending**. Inventory validation is host unit coverage; it does not
establish graphical behavior or complete Task 19A. The runtime evidence gate
and private collector have host-only regression coverage. The guarded E2E
launcher, collector integration and `make check-e2e` remain unfinished.

## Inspect scope on the host

From the checkout, these commands only read declarations and print JSON. They
need no root, package artifacts, installed product, graphical tools or VM:

```sh
python3 -B tests/e2e/inventory.py
python3 -B tests/e2e/inventory.py --scenario E2E-023
python3 -B tests/e2e/inventory.py --scenario E2E-023/fullscreen
```

An omitted selector lists every category, family and variant, including pending
work. An exact family selects all its variants. An exact `E2E-NNN/variant`
selects one case and is partial, even if the family currently has one variant.
Any explicit selection is partial relative to the full inventory. Empty,
unknown, wildcard, prefix and comma-separated selectors fail with exit 2.
`--require-runnable` also refuses any selection containing a pending variant;
it still only lists and never executes anything. Pending cases are never
silently filtered to obtain a successful selection.

The JSON includes canonical case IDs, owner, status/reason, parameters,
environment, prerequisites, duration bound, ordered phases, assertions,
expected evidence and the SHA-256 of the exact inventory bytes read. This digest
identifies the declaration only. The future runner must separately freeze and
identify current source, requirement mappings, packages, assets and environment.

## Maintain declarations

Schema version 1 has common family declarations inherited by each explicit
variant. Every variant has a stable ID and one canonical owner from the
family's related tasks. There is no runtime Cartesian expansion or duplicate
execution for related owners. Dimensions enumerate required values;
`full_combinations` names interacting groups whose entire product must appear
in explicit variants. Validation rejects missing values, missing combinations
and duplicate combinations. Independent sequential boundary checks belong in
the ordered steps and the matrix rationale. Owning tasks must audit and expand
this starting matrix before acceptance; declared matrix closure is not proof
that every product requirement or transition has been enumerated.

The first 29 families come from the required coverage table. E2E-030 adds
installed About/license access; E2E-031 covers feedback drafts, validation and
attachment/diagnostic review; E2E-032 covers authorized real delivery; E2E-033
covers retry after a declared real transport fault. Delivery prerequisites are
explicit authorization, a dedicated test recipient and the actual supported
service profile. Inventory registration grants no delivery permission.
Installation, About and feedback requirement-mapping gaps are explicit pending
work with owners and authoritative contract references. They must be mapped
before those cases become ready. No existing requirement is marked covered.

`pending` requires a reason and a null executable. `ready` requires no pending
reason or requirement gap and an existing `tests/e2e/*.py` or `*.pm` reference
(including subdirectories) plus its unique executable test ID. Validation never
imports or runs those files. Ready means registered for execution, **not passed**;
the future collector must reconcile actual scheduling and completed results
with the selected identities. References cannot traverse outside `tests/e2e`,
including through a symlink.

Each attempt has distinct setup, start, ordered steps, end and cleanup phases.
Provisioning belongs only in setup and the outer reset only in cleanup.
Customer steps are UI actions, read-only observations or real waits. Fault and
controlled-environment operations require the matching category and a declared
intervention with actor, step and expected evidence. Every family declares
visible, backend and other-user assertions tied to actual journey steps. The
runner smoke instead checks host/source preservation without claiming a
customer isolation test. These typed declarations are not a sandbox for test
code: the launcher must enforce lifecycle, secret and observation boundaries.

## Minimum evidence declaration, version 1

The inventory pins required run and step field names. `evidence.py` now checks
runtime payloads against these declarations and `private_artifacts.py` verifies
collected copies. The controller integration and real acceptance are pending.

| Fields | Required meaning for the collector |
| --- | --- |
| `run_id`, `scenario_id`, `variant_id` | One independent attempt and its exact selected identity; reruns have new attempt IDs. |
| `source_sha256`, `inventory_sha256`, `package_sha256`, `assets_sha256`, `environment_id`, `baseline_sha256` | Current input provenance. A product-free smoke records an explicit null package identity, never an invented package digest. |
| `started_at`, `ended_at`, `steps` | Actual attempt boundaries and ordered step records, including failure/interruption. |
| `artifacts` | Collected, validated private artifact references with content digests and redaction status; never credentials or arbitrary raw worker output. |
| `outcomes`, `first_failure`, `cleanup` | Separate product, infrastructure, collection and cleanup outcomes; preserve the first failure and record lease/host/baseline restoration. A passing diagnostic retry cannot replace it. |
| Step `step_id`, `phase`, `operation`, `outcome`, `monotonic_seconds` | Actual execution order, declared operation and bounded measured timing. |
| Step `boot_id`, `session_ids`, `assertion_ids`, `artifact_ids` | Real continuity, using safe identity aliases in exported evidence, and links to executed assertions and collected evidence. |

Expected evidence always includes action trace, screen, backend, other-user,
continuity, input provenance, split outcomes and cleanup. Declared faults also
require intervention evidence, and external-delivery scenarios require delivery
evidence. Missing, extra, duplicate, skipped, failed or stale required results,
unsafe artifacts and failed cleanup prevent a runtime pass. Task 27 extends
this minimum contract and connects evidence across all layers.

## Runtime gate and private collector

The guarded controller constructs `EvidenceContract` before executing a selection,
with a fresh `run_id`, the inventory path, selector and independently verified
input identities. Construction refuses pending cases and stale inventory bytes.
The contract freezes the plan and inputs; it never obtains expected provenance
from worker results. The source identity must cover requirement mappings, test
code and uncommitted changes. The launcher must establish that identity and
verify preservation after execution. An explicit null package digest is allowed
only when every selected case is a product-free runner smoke.

`validate(records, collector)` accepts one record per selected case in selection
order. Version 1 extends the minimum run fields with `schema_version`, exact
`executable` identity, executed `assertions`, and ordered `failures`. Each assertion
has `assertion_id`, `step_id`, `kind`, `outcome` and nonempty `artifact_ids`.
Visible/backend/other-user assertions require their corresponding evidence kind
on the declared step. Every artifact must be linked from a step, every declared
evidence kind must be present, and the records must exactly match the collector's
manifest. The collector rechecks permissions, directory identity and copy digests
at the gate. Unknown fields are refused, rather than silently discarded.

Step `monotonic_seconds` is elapsed time from the case's setup start, in
nondecreasing order, bounded by its declared duration and actual UTC boundaries
(one second of timestamp rounding tolerance). `boot-N` and `session-N` are
run-local continuity aliases; the controller maintains their mapping privately.
Recording an alias is not proof of a reboot or other-user isolation: the owning
assertion scripts must establish those facts. Customer operations must match the
inventory's exact phase and operation, including the sole outer cleanup reset.

The controller calls `record_failure(case_id, category, code, ...)` immediately
on observing a failure, using fixed safe codes, and obtains result fields from
`failure_state(case_id)`. Its append-only ledger prevents a worker payload from
removing or replacing the first failure. Product, infrastructure, collection
and cleanup remain independent outcomes. Any nonpassing outcome or step/assertion,
recorded failure, or incomplete cleanup refuses acceptance. Cleanup requires
`lease_phase=complete` plus true `owned_processes_stopped`, `vm_off`,
`baseline_restored`, `host_preserved` and `source_preserved` fields.

`PrivateCollector(run_id=..., secrets=[...])` creates a new private
`/tmp/onpc-e2e-evidence-*` directory. Keep it open through validation. Register
all fixture secrets before capture. `add` accepts reviewed bytes; `copy` accepts
one filename in a private source directory. Both require `reviewed=True` from
the trusted controller. This flag attests prior producer review, **not automatic
redaction**. The collector does not OCR images, discover unknown PII, or establish
that screenshots are safe. Producers must exclude authentication captures, raw
worker vars/logs, account names and other PII before collection. Secret scanning
(literal, JSON/URL/base64 and UTF-16 representations) is defense in depth.
Task 19A's worker integration must implement and exercise these capture boundaries.

Files are bounded to 16 MiB, copied as 0600 into 0700 storage, and identified
by digest, size, kind, run and redaction policy. No path traversal, symlink,
hardlink, FIFO/device, public permission, recursive copy or overwrite is allowed.
Source logs are never modified. Changed files and unregistered directory entries
refuse acceptance. `save_report` retains a controller's redacted structured
diagnostic record once, including failed/interrupted attempts; it does not grant
a passing result. Preserve the original report and allocate a new run/collector
for a diagnostic retry. The launcher must persist failure history before risky
cleanup and retain the gate's fixed refusal code without raw exception output.

The gate returns `outcome=passed`, exact case IDs, inputs and full/partial scope
only after all checks pass. Partial selections remain partial. Host tests use
separate temporary ready inventories and synthetic reviewed payloads. They prove
the contract's acceptance/refusal behavior, not customer execution, screen
redaction, verified input capture, or VM restoration.

## Verify edits

```sh
tools/run-unit-tests tests/unit/test_e2e_inventory.py tests/unit/test_e2e_evidence.py -q
```

These tests run automatically in `make check` via ordinary unit discovery.
They cover selection refusal, pending/ready separation, matrix closure,
three-sided evidence declarations, malformed input, executable containment,
phase/intervention categories and host-only CLI behavior. Runtime tests also
cover exact result reconciliation, split outcomes, retained failures, provenance,
private copies, tampering, secret exclusion and file/directory replacement.
