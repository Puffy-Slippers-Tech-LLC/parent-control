# 044 — Visit retained users and existing windows

Estimate: 40–60 minutes for a focused implementation/validation cycle; not
a stop timer. Follow the [master session contract](../E2E-Execution-Plan.md#execute-one-task).

## Read only this context

Use the [scoped reading rules](../E2E-Execution-Plan.md#load-only-the-selected-context).
Read only the named block rows/callables, this recipe's selected cases and
applicable finite-data rows. Prerequisite IDs are completion checks; do not open
their task briefs. Do not load the full queue, catalogue, recipe book or inventory.

## Scope and prerequisites

Deliver **DESK09; FLOW15 and FLOW01 retained scopes**. First scheduled consumer: [E2E-014, case 40](../E2E-Scenario-Recipes.md#e2e-014).
Read the named [block contracts](../E2E-Building-Blocks.md#desktop-and-retained-session-entry), [related block contracts](../E2E-Building-Blocks.md#reusable-journey-fragments) and only the selected consumer's recipe.

Required tasks (queue IDs; use delivered scope, not predecessor briefs):

- **043a** — GDM02 retained-child lock entry; DESK08/11.
- **044a** — DESK10 same-desktop window switching.

Use the catalogue's maintained callables and a fresh attempt, never prior task/VM state.

## Implementation

Implement retained-user routing, reusing normal DESK10 window switching and the qualified fresh-child FLOW15 branch. Extend FLOW15 for explicit same/retained/lock/denied entry, and FLOW01 for retained Parent windows without reselection hiding state. Qualify the Parent and both child account/recipient bindings required for these entries. A retained Parent window may be on App Limits: reach Screen Limits with PARENT04 before reading PARENT03. The second administrator's management desktop/window remains the separate other-parent scope.

## Live VM acceptance

On the VM, leave recognizable windows on child and Parent desktops, switch between them, unlock normally and foreground the same windows. Wrong entry modes fail without repairing state; compare retained public activity before relaunching anything.

Run affected safety/adapter checks, then implement and register the fixed slice
qualification below in the existing guarded envelope. Run this slice here;
its complete scenario remains a separate queue task:

```sh
tools/run-tests integration check_e2e_retained_entry
```

This selector must exist under the master's [qualification contract](../E2E-Execution-Plan.md#live-verification-contract)
before invocation. Require every stated result, independent valid entry, wrong-entry
refusal and owned cleanup on the live VM. Host tests and a diagnostic slice do not
establish complete scenario coverage.

## Close out

After this slice's live qualification and cleanup, follow the
[master completion contract](../E2E-Execution-Plan.md#completion-and-document-cleanup).
Update the relevant callable/scope/status in
[E2E-Building-Blocks.md](../E2E-Building-Blocks.md) and update the selected recipe only when
its composition changes. Runtime status belongs in the inventory; leave
unfinished scope pending.
Check **044** in the [master's queue](../E2E-Task-Queue.md), update the master's
**Next task** pointer, then delete this brief once its enduring context is maintained
in source/contracts. Validate changed Markdown. Keep normal runner artifacts;
no task archive, evidence document or accumulated history.
