# 042 — Observe and qualify an intended lock challenge

Estimate: 40–60 minutes for a focused implementation/validation cycle; not
a stop timer. Follow the [master session contract](../E2E-Execution-Plan.md#execute-one-task).

## Read only this context

Use the [scoped reading rules](../E2E-Execution-Plan.md#load-only-the-selected-context).
Read only the named block rows/callables, this recipe's selected cases and
applicable finite-data rows. Prerequisite IDs are completion checks; do not open
their task briefs. Do not load the full queue, catalogue, recipe book or inventory.

## Scope and prerequisites

Deliver **DESK05, DESK06, DESK07**. First scheduled consumer: [E2E-014, case 40](../E2E-Scenario-Recipes.md#e2e-014).
Read the named [block contracts](../E2E-Building-Blocks.md#desktop-and-retained-session-entry) and only the selected consumer's recipe.

Required tasks (queue IDs; use delivered scope, not predecessor briefs):

- **003d** — DESK04 current Shell logout/confirmation route and independently observed GDM return.

Use the catalogue's maintained callables and a fresh attempt, never prior task/VM state.

## Implementation

Implement normal explicit Lock, curtain/challenge observation and a separate public lock-recipient proof. Bind intended identity and empty focused masked field; GDM proofs never authorize lock input.

Resolve this actual Shell lock surface separately from GDM and the desktop menu. Observe that ordinary desktop input is blocked while locked. Reject ambiguous or wrong-owner challenges and qualify the guarded reveal/input/readback on the pinned VM.

## Live VM acceptance

On the VM, lock an observed usable fixture desktop, reveal its challenge through one declared normal key, and qualify the correct recipient. Refuse wrong-user/nonempty/stale proofs; this explicit Lock earns no natural-expiry credit.

Run affected safety/adapter checks, then implement and register the fixed slice
qualification below in the existing guarded envelope. Run this slice here;
its complete scenario remains a separate queue task:

```sh
tools/run-tests integration check_e2e_lock_recipient
```

This selector must exist under the master's [qualification contract](../E2E-Execution-Plan.md#live-verification-contract)
before invocation. Require every stated result, independent valid entry, wrong-entry
refusal and owned cleanup on the live VM. Host tests and a diagnostic slice do not
establish complete scenario coverage.

## Close out

After this slice's live qualification and cleanup, follow the
[master completion contract](../E2E-Execution-Plan.md#completion-and-document-cleanup).
Update the relevant callable/scope/status in
[E2E-Building-Blocks.md](../E2E-Building-Blocks.md) and update the selected recipe only when
its composition changes. Runtime status belongs in the inventory; leave
unfinished scope pending.
Check **042** in the [master's queue](../E2E-Task-Queue.md), update the master's
**Next task** pointer, then delete this brief once its enduring context is maintained
in source/contracts. Validate changed Markdown. Keep normal runner artifacts;
no task archive, evidence document or accumulated history.
