# 043 — Qualify fresh child login and time denial

Estimate: 30–50 minutes for a focused implementation/validation cycle; not
a stop timer. Follow the [master session contract](../E2E-Execution-Plan.md#execute-one-task).

## Scope and prerequisites

Deliver **GDM06/07, DESK01 and FLOW15 child fresh entry/denial; DESK11 rejected-GDM return**. First scheduled consumer: [E2E-015, case 49](../E2E-Scenario-Recipes.md#e2e-015).
Read the named [block contracts](../E2E-Building-Blocks.md#sign-in-and-desktop-entry), [related block contracts](../E2E-Building-Blocks.md#desktop-and-retained-session-entry), [related block contracts](../E2E-Building-Blocks.md#reusable-journey-fragments) and only the selected consumer's recipe.

Required implemented capabilities (IDs identify master rows; no predecessor brief is needed):

- **004** — UI19/GDM05 distinct single-use authentication challenges.
- **041** — PARENT09, FLOW02.

Use the catalogue's maintained callables and a fresh attempt, never prior task/VM state.

## Implementation

Bind the intended child's fresh GDM recipient, success and explicit time-limit denial. Reuse two fresh recipient proofs and sealed single-use input. Then bind FLOW15(gdm, child, fresh, expected result) to that qualified GDM07 path. Implement DESK11's normal Back/Cancel route from the observed rejected sign-in screen.

## Live VM acceptance

In separate live attempts, use Parent controls to prepare positive daily time or zero daily/no grant, then Switch User and perform a fresh child login through FLOW15. Require a usable child desktop for the former and the specific time-limit rejection after correct authentication for the latter. Return normally from rejection to GDM. Generic authentication failure is insufficient.

Run affected safety/adapter checks, then use the complete first consumer if runnable.
Otherwise implement/reuse the planned fixed qualification:

```sh
tools/run-tests integration check_e2e_unlock
```

This selector must exist under the master's [qualification contract](../E2E-Execution-Plan.md#live-verification-contract)
before invocation. Require every stated result, independent valid entry, wrong-entry
refusal and owned cleanup on the live VM. Host tests and a diagnostic slice do not
establish complete scenario coverage.

## Close out

After live qualification and cleanup, update the callable, exact qualified scope
and status in [E2E-Building-Blocks.md](../E2E-Building-Blocks.md), and reconcile
the first consumer's status in [E2E-Scenario-Recipes.md](../E2E-Scenario-Recipes.md).
A slice alone leaves the full scenario pending. If any complete E2E scenario
passed, run `tools/generate_test_coverage.sh` after that case's cleanup; it runs
`tools/generate_test_coverage.py`. Require successful generation before check-off.

Check this task in the [master](../E2E-Execution-Plan.md), then remove this brief
when its enduring context is in source/contracts and replace its master link
with plain text. Validate changed Markdown with `tools/read-only links`.
Keep normal runner artifacts; no new evidence document or accumulated history.
