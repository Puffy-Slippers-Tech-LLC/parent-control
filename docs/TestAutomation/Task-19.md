# Task 19 — os-autoinst end-to-end test distribution

Execute 19A and 19B separately. Reuse the implemented
[baseline validation and artifact contract](../../tests/integration/README.md)
on the existing fixed VM. Read the mandatory
[real operations and scenario coverage contract](E2E-Coverage.md). No new VM, snapshot, or overlay may bypass the approved ownership workflow.

## Task 19A

- Title: Add the guarded os-autoinst worker and console transport.
- Depends on: Task 18C.
- Complexity: very high. Guest ownership, storage, secrets, console transport,
  and cleanup must be correct before any graphical scenario can be trusted.
- Recommended Codex model: `gpt-6-astra`
- Recommended reasoning effort: `high`
- Work:
  1. First resolve the backend/VM ownership contract: verify from current public
     documentation and a bounded smoke that the planned maintained graphical
     backend can drive the guarded existing VM without owning a second guest,
     creating overlays/checkpoints, bypassing identity checks, or using private
     APIs. Reuse the existing guarded lease for lifecycle control. Do not assume the
     earlier os-autoinst QEMU-backend proposal is compatible; if no supported
     integration is demonstrated, report the concrete design blocker before
     building scenarios. Do not silently change VM ownership or fake E2E.
  2. Add `tests/e2e`, its distribution/entry point, public console definitions,
     configuration templates, read-only guest assertion scripts, and launcher
     for the verified backend. Pin required maintained tooling through
     `setup.sh` and the test-tool list. Never use a root-password shortcut or
     attach to any VM except the lease-validated test VM.
  3. Validate the retained product-free baseline, restore it only before/after a
     complete attempt, and transfer digest-verified assets without writable
     host shares. Add `make check-e2e ARTIFACT_DIR=... SCENARIO=<id>`; refuse
     `VM_IMAGE`. No checkpoint/resume operation is available within a journey.
  4. Provide guest keyboard/mouse graphics and supported read-only observation
     transport. Keep complex assertions in versioned guest scripts/pytest;
     customer actions use the real guest UI. Separate provisioning, observation,
     and declared fault controls so a helper cannot silently set grants,
     preferences, authentication results, session state, or expiry outcomes.
  5. Pass credentials through os-autoinst secret variables and its secret-safe
     password API. Exclude them from screenshots, output, and vars artifacts.
  6. Implement bounded startup, shutdown, interruption, copied-artifact
     collection, and ownership-recorded cleanup. Add guard and cleanup-safety
     regressions, including identity replacement and rejected source disks.
  7. Prove one fresh guest boots, executes a harmless serial command, returns
     evidence, and shuts down. Document console, secret, asset, and helper
     contracts for 19B and later scenarios.
  8. Establish `tests/e2e/scenarios.json` from E2E-Coverage.md with stable scenario
     and variant IDs, category, owner, requirement links, preconditions, ordered
     steps, interventions, assertions, executable references, and expected
     evidence. Future cases remain explicitly pending. Enumerate the coverage
     dimensions before implementing them; task completion cannot substitute
     one smoke or the user's sample for the complete customer inventory.
- Verification:
  - Run cleanup-safety regressions in isolation before starting a guest.
  - Run host-safe guard/refusal tests and the fresh-guest serial smoke.
  - Check baseline/source/host preservation and secret exclusion.
  - Verify runner guards reject in-journey snapshot/checkpoint requests and
    state-writing observation helpers. Inspect the smoke's action trace and
    distinguish outer reset, real machine actions, observations, and cleanup.
  - Run `make check` and `git diff --check`.
- Completion criteria: a guarded outside-guest runner provides working graphical
  and observation transports on the approved VM, owned cleanup, redacted
  artifacts, and the enumerable scenario contract. No backend compatibility
  or customer coverage is claimed without executed evidence.

## Task 19B

- Title: Add stable screen matching and graphical smoke.
- Depends on: Task 19A.
- Complexity: medium. This uses the established runner and console contracts.
- Recommended Codex model: `gpt-5.6-terra`
- Recommended reasoning effort: `medium`
- Work:
  1. Add reusable login/GDM, console-switching, and screenshot helpers and initial
     needles. Match small stable regions/text, use explicit click points, and
     exclude clocks and animation instead of matching entire screens.
  2. Add the smoke scenario: boot a fresh product-free guest, recognize GDM,
     switch to serial, execute a harmless command, switch back, record a
     screenshot, and shut down.
  3. Document helper usage, match deadlines, failure artifacts, and exact smoke
     invocation for later scenario tasks.
- Verification:
  - Run cleanup-safety regressions in isolation, then run the graphical smoke
    three consecutive complete qualification attempts, resetting the baseline only
    outside attempts. Mark this `runner-smoke`, not customer acceptance.
    This repetition qualifies the new harness; the ordinary suite runs the
    registered smoke once per attempt, not three times on every invocation.
  - Review screenshots, video, serial output, secret exclusion, and cleanup.
  - Run `make check` and `git diff --check`.
- Completion criteria: stable public-API graphical/serial automation is ready
  for user journeys, without host-window automation, unguarded domain access,
  or VM state shortcuts. Screen/step evidence records actual input and outcomes.
