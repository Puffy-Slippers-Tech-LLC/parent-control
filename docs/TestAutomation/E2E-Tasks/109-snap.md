# 109 — Qualify Snap fixtures and command launches

Estimate: 35–55 minutes for a focused implementation/validation cycle; not
a stop timer. Follow the [master session contract](../E2E-Execution-Plan.md#execute-one-task).

## Read only this context

Use the [scoped reading rules](../E2E-Execution-Plan.md#load-only-the-selected-context).
Read only the named block rows/callables, this recipe's selected cases and
applicable finite-data rows. Prerequisite IDs are completion checks; do not open
their task briefs. Do not load the full queue, catalogue, recipe book or inventory.

## Scope and prerequisites

Deliver **APP01/02/03/04 and FLOW08 Snap command route**. First scheduled consumer: [E2E-019, case 92](../E2E-Scenario-Recipes.md#e2e-019).
Read the named [block contracts](../E2E-Building-Blocks.md#fixture-boundaries-and-the-common-attempt-envelope), [related block contracts](../E2E-Building-Blocks.md#customer-terminal-files-and-application-use) and only the selected consumer's recipe.

Required tasks (queue IDs; use delivered scope, not predecessor briefs):

- **109p** — FIX04 Snap assets; LIFE04 fixed Snap installation profile.
- **079a** — APP02 and FLOW08 native grid/command policy results.

Use the catalogue's maintained callables and a fresh attempt, never prior task/VM state.

## Implementation

Reuse the qualified FIX04/LIFE04 Snap profile from task 109p in a fresh attempt.
Qualify APP01/02/03 for the fixed Snap command route, then APP04 activity identity
and FLOW08. Register the supported new-window command so presenting an existing
window cannot pass a new launch. Use the repository-owned fixture IDs. Package
installation is already qualified and must not be reimplemented here.

## Live VM acceptance

On the VM, use the declared Snap command to launch each required fixture and observe normal input effects. Capture S, open a distinguishable second instance and prove the earlier activity remains. Through Parent, apply Hard and Soft blocks and require explicit command denial and the expected closure, with A still usable. A missing supported asset, new-instance route or public observation blocks the affected consumer.

Run affected safety/adapter checks, then implement and register the fixed slice
qualification below in the existing guarded envelope. Run this slice here;
its complete scenario remains a separate queue task:

```sh
tools/run-tests integration check_e2e_snap
```

This selector must exist under the master's [qualification contract](../E2E-Execution-Plan.md#live-verification-contract)
before invocation. Require every stated result, independent valid entry, wrong-entry
refusal and owned cleanup on the live VM. Host tests and a diagnostic slice do not
establish complete scenario coverage.

## Close out

After this slice's live qualification and cleanup, follow the
[master completion contract](../E2E-Execution-Plan.md#completion-and-document-cleanup).
Update the relevant callable/scope/status in
[E2E-Building-Blocks.md](../E2E-Building-Blocks.md) and update the selected recipe only when
its composition changes. Runtime status belongs in the inventory; leave
unfinished scope pending.
Check **109** in the [master's queue](../E2E-Task-Queue.md), update the master's
**Next task** pointer, then delete this brief once its enduring context is maintained
in source/contracts. Validate changed Markdown. Keep normal runner artifacts;
no task archive, evidence document or accumulated history.
