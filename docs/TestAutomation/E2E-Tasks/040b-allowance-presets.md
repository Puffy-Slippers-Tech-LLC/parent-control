# 040b — Select and read ordinary daily presets

Estimate: 20–30 minutes. Aim for one session; this is not a stop timer.
Follow the [session contract](../E2E-Execution-Plan.md#task-size-and-order).

## Scope and prerequisites

Deliver **PARENT05 preset 0/15 selection and saved readback**. Named consumer: task **040** and any
complete cases released directly by this slice in the canonical queue.

Required tasks (queue IDs; use delivered scope, not predecessor briefs):

- **009** — UI16.
- **017** — PARENT08 snapshot saved/control states; installed qualification and owned cleanup passed.

## Read only this context

Read only the delivered block rows and their named callables in the
[catalogue](../E2E-Building-Blocks.md), the selected consumer's recipe clauses,
and the affected safety/adapter tests. Follow the
[scoped reading rules](../E2E-Execution-Plan.md#load-only-the-selected-context).
Use delivered prerequisite scopes; do not open predecessor briefs.

## Implementation

Use the public allowance picker and existing toggle/save observers to select ordinary presets. Keep custom input out of this slice.

Keep repository-owned targets addressed by public automation IDs. External
provider bindings use the approved scoped adapter and its ownership, ambiguity,
freshness and uncertain-input guards. Reuse the existing attempt envelope,
observer and worker; add no independent runner or fixture framework.

## Live VM acceptance

Enable limits, save preset 0 then preset 15, independently observe each save and reopen the picker to read the selected value. Wrong-child and disabled controls refuse.

Use a fresh guarded VM attempt through shared watchvm intent, display and
command transport. Pass affected cleanup/ownership regressions in isolation
first. Require independent valid entry, wrong-entry refusal, public results,
sanitized collection and owned cleanup. Secret and shared infrastructure changes
retain all applicable regression requirements from the master.

Implement and register this fixed argument-free qualification, with its cleanup
coverage, before invoking it:

```sh
tools/run-tests integration check_e2e_allowance_presets
```

The selector is planned, not currently qualified. Host checks alone cannot
complete this slice, and it supplies no complete-scenario acceptance credit.

## Close out

Follow the [master close-out](../E2E-Execution-Plan.md#completion-and-document-cleanup).
Record only the actual callable and qualified slice in the catalogue. After
acceptance and cleanup pass, check **040b**, advance the sole pointer to the
following unchecked row and delete this brief after enduring context is in
source/contracts. Keep any unmet gate and its return condition on this task;
do not advance around it.
