# 183e — Close the station during pending approval

Estimate: 25–55 minutes for a focused implementation/validation cycle; not
a stop timer. Follow the [master session contract](../E2E-Execution-Plan.md#execute-one-task).

## Read only this context

Use the [scoped reading rules](../E2E-Execution-Plan.md#load-only-the-selected-context).
Read only the named block rows/callables, this recipe's selected cases and
applicable finite-data rows. Prerequisite IDs are completion checks; do not open
their task briefs. Do not load the full queue, catalogue, recipe book or inventory.

## Scope and prerequisites

Deliver **FLOW17 kiosk app-close**. First scheduled consumer: [E2E-039, case 175](../E2E-Scenario-Recipes.md#e2e-039).
Read the named [block contracts](../E2E-Building-Blocks.md#reusable-journey-fragments) and only the selected consumer's recipe.

**Gate:** The normal leave/close action must be reachable while the real prompt is pending. If the modal prevents it, leave this binding pending; signals, forced logout and agent Cancel cannot replace it.

Required tasks (queue IDs; use delivered scope, not predecessor briefs):

- **020** — AUTH02 and REQUEST11/12 kiosk approval/rejection/cancel and both approved exits.
- **014** — FLOW04 kiosk.
- **180** — FLOW01 same-user entry; FLOW16 fresh/same Parent allowance setup.
- **044** — DESK09; FLOW15 and FLOW01 retained scopes.
- **052c** — TIME03.

Use the catalogue's maintained callables and a fresh attempt, never prior task/VM state.

## Implementation

Compose only the kiosk app-close branch with an already observed real AUTH01 prompt and explicit pre-request choices/balances. Use the supported normal station close action, observe GDM, then re-enter the station. Cancel on the agent is not this route. Read REQUEST03 and require the old prompt absent; a later request must authenticate afresh.

## Live VM acceptance

On the VM, publicly prepare usable time, capture choices/balances, start approval and perform the declared action while authentication is pending. Observe the destination and return, inspect cancellation and original balances before another request, then require a new prompt. Use TIME03 only for the actual cooldown.

Run affected safety/adapter checks, then implement and register the fixed slice
qualification below in the existing guarded envelope. Run this slice here;
its complete scenario remains a separate queue task:

```sh
tools/run-tests integration check_e2e_close_the_station_during_pending_approval
```

This selector must exist under the master's [qualification contract](../E2E-Execution-Plan.md#live-verification-contract)
before invocation. Require every stated result, independent valid entry, wrong-entry
refusal and owned cleanup on the live VM. Host tests and a diagnostic slice do not
establish complete scenario coverage.

## Close out

After this slice's live qualification and cleanup, follow the
[master completion contract](../E2E-Execution-Plan.md#completion-and-document-cleanup).
Update the relevant callable/scope/status in
[E2E-Building-Blocks.md](../E2E-Building-Blocks.md) and update the selected recipe only when
its composition changes. Runtime status belongs in the inventory; leave
unfinished scope pending.
Check **183e** in the [master's queue](../E2E-Task-Queue.md), update the master's
**Next task** pointer, then delete this brief once its enduring context is maintained
in source/contracts. Validate changed Markdown. Keep normal runner artifacts;
no task archive, evidence document or accumulated history.
