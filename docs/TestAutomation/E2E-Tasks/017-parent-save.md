# 017 — Observe Parent save results

Estimate: 25–45 minutes for a focused implementation/validation cycle; not
a stop timer. Follow the [master session contract](../E2E-Execution-Plan.md#execute-one-task).

## Read only this context

Use the [scoped reading rules](../E2E-Execution-Plan.md#load-only-the-selected-context).
Read only the named block rows/callables, this recipe's selected cases and
applicable finite-data rows. Prerequisite IDs are completion checks; do not open
their task briefs. Do not load the full queue, catalogue, recipe book or inventory.

## Scope and prerequisites

Deliver **PARENT08 snapshot saved/control states**. First scheduled consumer: [E2E-017, case 57](../E2E-Scenario-Recipes.md#e2e-017).
Read the named [block contracts](../E2E-Building-Blocks.md#app-grid-search-and-parent-launch) and only the selected consumer's recipe.

Required implemented capabilities (IDs identify queue rows; no predecessor brief is needed):

- **010** — UI17.

Use the catalogue's maintained callables and a fresh attempt, never prior task/VM state.

## Implementation

Implement bounded snapshot observations of terminal saved state and control availability after a caller-owned change. Register only states reproducible through the selected public operation. Transition tracing is a separate scope and must not be inferred from a final snapshot.

## Live VM acceptance

On installed Parent, change Screen time limit through UI17, observe successful save and the resulting public control states, then read them again from an independently reached Parent window. A missing expected result or wrong child fails; no transient-saving claim is made.

Run affected safety/adapter checks, then use the complete first consumer if runnable.
Otherwise implement/reuse the planned fixed qualification:

```sh
tools/run-tests integration check_e2e_parent_save
```

This selector must exist under the master's [qualification contract](../E2E-Execution-Plan.md#live-verification-contract)
before invocation. Require every stated result, independent valid entry, wrong-entry
refusal and owned cleanup on the live VM. Host tests and a diagnostic slice do not
establish complete scenario coverage.

## Close out

After this slice's live qualification and cleanup, follow the
[master completion contract](../E2E-Execution-Plan.md#completion-and-document-cleanup).
If a complete E2E scenario passed, refresh coverage immediately after that case.
Use `tools/generate_test_coverage.sh`, which runs `tools/generate_test_coverage.py`.

Update the relevant callable/scope/status in
[E2E-Building-Blocks.md](../E2E-Building-Blocks.md) and the selected family's status
in [E2E-Scenario-Recipes.md](../E2E-Scenario-Recipes.md); leave unfinished scope pending.
Check **017** in the [master's queue](../E2E-Task-Queue.md), update the master's
**Next task** pointer, then delete this brief once its enduring context is maintained
in source/contracts. Validate changed Markdown. Keep normal runner artifacts;
no task archive, evidence document or accumulated history.
