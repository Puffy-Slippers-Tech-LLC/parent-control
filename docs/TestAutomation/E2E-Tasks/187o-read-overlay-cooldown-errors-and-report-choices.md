# 187o — Read overlay cooldown errors and report choices

Estimate: 30–50 minutes for a focused implementation/validation cycle; not
a stop timer. Follow the [master session contract](../E2E-Execution-Plan.md#execute-one-task).

## Read only this context

Use the [scoped reading rules](../E2E-Execution-Plan.md#load-only-the-selected-context).
Read only the named block rows/callables, this recipe's selected cases and
applicable finite-data rows. Prerequisite IDs are completion checks; do not open
their task briefs. Do not load the full queue, catalogue, recipe book or inventory.

## Scope and prerequisites

Deliver **REQUEST09 cooldown and FEED15 overlay**. First scheduled consumer: [E2E-039, case 176](../E2E-Scenario-Recipes.md#e2e-039).
Read the named [block contracts](../E2E-Building-Blocks.md#kiosk-child-overlay-and-the-shared-request-form), [related block contracts](../E2E-Building-Blocks.md#additional-public-surfaces) and only the selected consumer's recipe.

**Gate:** The normal overlay reopen-and-Request sequence must complete within the actual five-second cooldown.

Required implemented capabilities (IDs identify queue rows; no predecessor brief is needed):

- **048b** — Overlay AUTH01/02, valid REQUEST09, REQUEST11/12 both approved exits and FLOW05/07.
- **044** — DESK09; FLOW15 and FLOW01 retained scopes.
- **052c** — TIME03.
- **030** — FEED05; FEED10 dialog persistence.

Use the catalogue's maintained callables and a fresh attempt, never prior task/VM state.

## Implementation

Qualify the public reopen/Request route within the actual five-second cooldown, then report-review/decline bindings and their overlay destinations. Reuse selected-parent approval; never extend product timing.

## Live VM acceptance

On the VM, approve once, reopen and Request before five seconds from success, and read the actual too-soon result. In independent attempts review and decline reporting, checking form/report destinations and original balance before any new approval.

Run affected safety/adapter checks, then use the complete first consumer if runnable.
Otherwise implement/reuse the planned fixed qualification:

```sh
tools/run-tests integration check_e2e_read_overlay_cooldown_errors_and_report_choices
```

This selector must exist under the master's [qualification contract](../E2E-Execution-Plan.md#live-verification-contract)
before invocation. Require every stated result, independent valid entry, wrong-entry
refusal and owned cleanup on the live VM. Host tests and a diagnostic slice do not
establish complete scenario coverage.

## Close out

After this slice's live qualification and cleanup, follow the
[master completion contract](../E2E-Execution-Plan.md#completion-and-document-cleanup).
If a complete E2E scenario passed, refresh coverage immediately after that case.
Use `tools/generate_test_coverage.sh`, which runs `tools/generate_test_coverage.py`.

Update the relevant callable/scope/status in
[E2E-Building-Blocks.md](../E2E-Building-Blocks.md) and the selected family's status
in [E2E-Scenario-Recipes.md](../E2E-Scenario-Recipes.md); leave unfinished scope pending.
Check **187o** in the [master's queue](../E2E-Task-Queue.md), update the master's
**Next task** pointer, then delete this brief once its enduring context is maintained
in source/contracts. Validate changed Markdown. Keep normal runner artifacts;
no task archive, evidence document or accumulated history.
