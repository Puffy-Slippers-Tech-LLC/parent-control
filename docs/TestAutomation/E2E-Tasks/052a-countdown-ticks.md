# 052a — Measure displayed countdown ticks

Estimate: 30–50 minutes for a focused implementation/validation cycle; not
a stop timer. Follow the [master session contract](../E2E-Execution-Plan.md#execute-one-task).

## Scope and prerequisites

Deliver **TIME02 minute/final-second ticks**. First scheduled consumer: [E2E-008, case 21](../E2E-Scenario-Recipes.md#e2e-008).
Read the named [block contracts](../E2E-Building-Blocks.md#time-and-ordinary-lifecycle-boundaries) and only the selected consumer's recipe.

Required implemented capabilities (IDs identify master rows; no predecessor brief is needed):

- **052** — TIME01 child-desktop snapshots.
- **051** — FLOW13 daily-only, fresh/same Parent entry with observed G=0.
- **052c** — TIME03.

Use the catalogue's maintained callables and a fresh attempt, never prior task/VM state.

## Implementation

Compose TIME02 from TIME01, guarded TIME03 intervals and explicit UI12 elapsed-time comparisons. Declare public precision, formatting and tolerances before execution. Keep elapsed time distinct from an enforcement result.

## Live VM acceptance

On the live VM, publicly establish short daily-only time, enter the child and observe minute ticks and final-second changes over real measured intervals. Require the declared sample order and tolerances. No guest clock adjustment or usage probe is allowed.

Run affected safety/adapter checks, then use the complete first consumer if runnable.
Otherwise implement/reuse the planned fixed qualification:

```sh
tools/run-tests integration check_e2e_countdown
```

This selector must exist under the master's [qualification contract](../E2E-Execution-Plan.md#live-verification-contract)
before invocation. Require every stated result, independent valid entry, wrong-entry
refusal and owned cleanup on the live VM. Host tests and a diagnostic slice do not
establish complete scenario coverage.

## Close out

After live qualification and cleanup, update the callable, exact qualified scope
and status in [E2E-Building-Blocks.md](../E2E-Building-Blocks.md), and reconcile
the first consumer's status in [E2E-Scenario-Recipes.md](../E2E-Scenario-Recipes.md).
A slice alone leaves the full scenario pending. If any complete E2E scenario
passed, run `tools/generate_test_coverage.sh` after that case's cleanup; it runs
`tools/generate_test_coverage.py`. Require successful generation before check-off.

Check this task in the [master](../E2E-Execution-Plan.md), then remove this brief
when its enduring context is in source/contracts and replace its master link
with plain text. Validate changed Markdown with `tools/read-only links`.
Keep normal runner artifacts; no new evidence document or accumulated history.
