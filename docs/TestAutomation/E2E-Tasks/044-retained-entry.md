# 044 — Visit retained users and existing windows

Budget: 40–60 minutes, including a normal verification cycle; this is not a stop timer.
Follow the [master session contract](../E2E-Execution-Plan.md#execute-one-task) and repository approvals.

## Scope and entry

Consumer: E2E-005 retained visits; E2E-007 isolation. Scope: DESK09; FLOW15 and FLOW01 retained scopes. Reuse already-qualified DESK10 window switching.

Required implemented capabilities: DESK08, DESK11 and DESK10. Use maintained callables and an independent public entry state, never an earlier task document or attempt.

Contract: the named [catalogue rows](../E2E-Building-Blocks.md#ordered-building-block-catalogue) and consumer recipe. Qualify only the bindings named here.

## Work

Implement retained-user routing, reusing normal DESK10 window switching and the qualified fresh-child FLOW15 branch. Extend FLOW15 for explicit same/retained/lock/denied entry, and FLOW01 for retained Parent windows without reselection hiding state. Qualify the additional account/recipient bindings required for these entries.

## Live VM acceptance

On the VM, leave recognizable windows on child and Parent desktops, switch between them, unlock normally and foreground the same windows. Wrong entry modes fail without repairing state; compare retained public activity before relaunching anything.

Run affected safety/worker checks, then planned fixed qualification `tools/run-tests integration check_e2e_allowance`, or the full named consumer if runnable. Reuse/create the fixed entry under the master's qualification contract. Every result above and owned cleanup must pass on the live VM; diagnostic success earns no scenario coverage.

## Close out

After successful cleanup, check this task in the [master](../E2E-Execution-Plan.md) and update [catalogue/scenario status](../E2E-Building-Blocks.md) using its readiness rules. Delete this task when no longer needed, replacing its master link with plain text. No new evidence/history document.
