# 172k — Check lock-provider recovery

Required tasks: 172c, 172j.
Estimate: 30–60 minutes.
Session exception: keep the finite fault/order, original deadline, recovery and
owned cleanup together on both supported targets.

Use the [shared task contract](../E2E-Execution-Contracts.md#task-brief-contract),
[system acceptance](../E2E-Execution-Contracts.md#system-acceptance), and
[expiry engineering contract](../UI-and-E2E-Coverage.md#expiry-engineering-contract).
Read only the affected current callbacks and shared mechanics, including their
callers, state and cleanup; discover actual selectors in area `session`.

## Scope and acceptance

Use separate finite attempts for unavailable native lock action and replacement of org.gnome.ScreenSaver on an otherwise live child bus. Observe actual protected input, retained work, peer continuity and bounded supported recovery. Confirm owner/availability and legitimate renewal commit directly; entitled state must prevent a stale retry. Reuse 172j’s observations without repeating its acknowledgement matrix; task 172i alone owns bus-process replacement. Missing retry behavior remains explicit.

This is installed system qualification, with no customer-case acceptance credit.
Extend the existing system-282 owner only for these missing assertions; reuse
covered mechanics and register the distinct binding once before execution.
Run the affected host checks with explicit timeouts and this installed delta on
`onpc-Ubuntu26.04` and `onpc-Fedora44`. Task completion does not rerun unchanged
predecessor checks or close any canonical customer row.

At [close-out](../E2E-Execution-Contracts.md#completion-and-document-cleanup),
record actual selectors, qualified scope and unresolved limits in the coverage
allocation and owning runtime documentation; advance only this queue row.
