# 048 — Reveal the child's request entry

Estimate: 40–60 minutes for a focused implementation/validation cycle; not
a stop timer. Follow the [master session contract](../E2E-Execution-Plan.md#execute-one-task).

## Read only this context

Use the [scoped reading rules](../E2E-Execution-Plan.md#load-only-the-selected-context).
Read only the named block rows/callables, this recipe's selected cases and
applicable finite-data rows. Prerequisite IDs are completion checks; do not open
their task briefs. Do not load the full queue, catalogue, recipe book or inventory.

## Scope and prerequisites

Deliver **DESK12, REQUEST02/03 overlay entry/readback**. First scheduled consumer: [E2E-015, case 44](../E2E-Scenario-Recipes.md#e2e-015).
Read the named [block contracts](../E2E-Building-Blocks.md#desktop-and-retained-session-entry), [related block contracts](../E2E-Building-Blocks.md#kiosk-child-overlay-and-the-shared-request-form) and only the selected consumer's recipe.

Required tasks (queue IDs; use delivered scope, not predecessor briefs):

- **043** — GDM06/07, DESK01 and FLOW15 child fresh entry/denial; DESK11 rejected-GDM return.
- **011** — REQUEST01, REQUEST03.

Use the catalogue's maintained callables and a fresh attempt, never prior task/VM state.

## Implementation

Qualify normal unlocked-child panel routing (DESK12), then panel input/form-count/fixed-child observation (REQUEST02/03). Reuse the shared immutable reader. Choice editing, exits and authentication are separately qualified bindings; fullscreen reveal belongs to its game consumer.

## Live VM acceptance

On the VM with publicly prepared usable child time and fresh child entry, open the overlay twice deliberately and observe exactly one form with the intended fixed child and readable controls. Repeat from an independently reached child desktop. Use its normal Cancel solely to end qualification; this does not qualify the reusable exit binding. Never select another overlay child.

Run affected safety/adapter checks, then implement and register the fixed slice
qualification below in the existing guarded envelope. Run this slice here;
its complete scenario remains a separate queue task:

```sh
tools/run-tests integration check_e2e_shell_panel
```

This selector must exist under the master's [qualification contract](../E2E-Execution-Plan.md#live-verification-contract)
before invocation. Require every stated result, independent valid entry, wrong-entry
refusal and owned cleanup on the live VM. Host tests and a diagnostic slice do not
establish complete scenario coverage.

## Close out

After this slice's live qualification and cleanup, follow the
[master completion contract](../E2E-Execution-Plan.md#completion-and-document-cleanup).
Update the relevant callable/scope/status in
[E2E-Building-Blocks.md](../E2E-Building-Blocks.md) and update the selected recipe only when
its composition changes. Runtime status belongs in the inventory; leave
unfinished scope pending.
Check **048** in the [master's queue](../E2E-Task-Queue.md), update the master's
**Next task** pointer, then delete this brief once its enduring context is maintained
in source/contracts. Validate changed Markdown. Keep normal runner artifacts;
no task archive, evidence document or accumulated history.
