# Task 19 — os-autoinst end-to-end test distribution

Execute 19P, 19A and 19B separately under the
[implementation workflow](Implementation-Workflow.md). Reuse the implemented
[baseline validation and artifact contract](../../tests/integration/README.md)
on the existing fixed VM. Read the mandatory
[real operations and scenario coverage contract](E2E-Coverage.md). No new VM, snapshot, or overlay may bypass the approved ownership workflow.

## Task 19P

- Title: Prove graphical backend compatibility before expanding coverage.
- Depends on: the implemented guarded lease; F1 is preferred for common
  diagnostic evidence but is not a graphical feasibility dependency.
- Complexity: high; a supported automation backend must fit existing ownership.
- Recommended Codex model: `gpt-6-astra`
- Recommended reasoning effort: `high`
- Work:
  1. Check current primary documentation for a maintained graphical backend
     that can control the existing lease-validated VM without a second guest,
     new overlay/snapshot, private API, host-window automation, or a different
     lifecycle owner. Evaluate the proposed os-autoinst integration first.
  2. Use one bounded smoke to prove real guest keyboard/mouse, screenshot and
     supported observation transport with the existing lease and cleanup.
     Follow isolated cleanup-safety prerequisites before live controls. If
     host tools are missing, record them and update `setup.sh` as needed under
     normal authorization; do not silently recreate the baseline.
  3. Record the supported backend/version/API, smallest working invocation,
     secret-input/capture boundaries, actual timings and remaining helper gaps.
     This is feasibility evidence, not E2E acceptance or the full 19A runner.
     Also identify availability of a reproducible offline game for Task 26C
     and any required external-delivery test profile; do not download a game
     or send feedback merely to inventory prerequisites.
- Verification: source-backed compatibility and one clean guarded smoke, plus
  focused checks for any helper code and `make check`/`git diff --check` when
  code changes. Apply the two-attempt diagnostic limit. If no supported path
  is established, record the concrete blocker and stop backend development;
  independent installed-system work may proceed. Do not mark 19P complete.
- Completion criteria: a supported integration is demonstrated with retained
  evidence and safe cleanup. Carry its implementation into 19A; do not repeat
  this feasibility investigation at every graphical task.

### Completion handoff — 2026-09-06, 19P accepted

**Completed:** three corrected-input full smokes (12–14) passed on the existing
guarded `ubuntu26.04` VM. Private review confirmed the real GDM account list,
mouse-selected empty credential prompt, and Escape return in every attempt.
Infrastructure, collection, host preservation and baseline cleanup passed.
The [acceptance evidence](Evidence/19P-Screen-Input-2026-09-06.md) retains exact
inputs, screen digests, timings and original failures. This establishes backend
feasibility; it does not accept the full 19A runner or customer E2E coverage.

**Correction:** the earlier stale-controller handoff was wrong. Smoke 13 was
still running after its command session ID was discarded; its final result is
passed/complete. The redundant invocation correctly refused the busy lease.
No controller repair, recovery, lock removal or process signal was needed.
The workflow now requires retaining and polling command session metadata.

**Reuse:** `os-autoinst=5.1768577300.b85e4864-1`, public test API 48 and
`generalhw`; `Adapter.open_display()` with public `openGraphicsFD(0, 0)`;
the namespace bridge and existing lease lifecycle owner; exact QEMU AppArmor
peer rule; observer-only SSH; and `GENERAL_HW_VNC_DEPTH=32`. The bounded
ten-second render settling and large fixed-baseline tile remain feasibility
helpers. Task 19B replaces geometry/readiness with needles. Invoke the smoke
through `pkexec /usr/local/libexec/onpc-test-runner integration check_graphical_smoke`.
The dispatcher supplies isolated safety prerequisites. Preserve private capture
handling and the [downstream prerequisite inventory](Evidence/19P-Backend-Preflight-2026-09-06.md#capture-cleanup-and-downstream-prerequisites).

**Session result:** reviewed smoke 13 (222.031 s), completed and reviewed smoke
14 (218.304 s), and passed `make check` (1,190 unit/contracts, 17 components,
syntax and traceability) plus `git diff --check`. Review exports were deleted
through the approved helper; raw evidence remains private. The final runner
exited successfully with `lease_phase=complete`; no VM operation is pending.

**Next action:** Task 14 subsequently passed final acceptance; proceed to
[Task 19A's active handoff](#task-19a-continuation--2026-09-07). The previous
Polkit investigation and 19P qualification are complete. Use the active
handoff's settings for the next slice.

## Task 19A

- Title: Add the guarded os-autoinst worker and console transport.
- Depends on: Task 19P and F1; the preferred schedule follows Task 14.
- Complexity: very high. Guest ownership, storage, secrets, console transport,
  and cleanup must be correct before any graphical scenario can be trusted.
- Recommended Codex model: `gpt-6-astra`
- Recommended reasoning effort: `high`
- Work:
  1. Reuse 19P's demonstrated backend and F1's selection/evidence conventions.
     Revalidate the compatibility decision only if the backend, environment or
     ownership contract changed. The guarded lease remains lifecycle owner;
     no second guest, new overlays/checkpoints or private APIs are permitted.
  2. Add `tests/e2e`, its distribution/entry point, public console definitions,
     configuration templates, read-only guest assertion scripts, and launcher
     for the verified backend. Pin required maintained tooling through
     `setup.sh` and the test-tool list. Never use a root-password shortcut or
     attach to any VM except the lease-validated test VM.
  3. Validate the retained product-free baseline, restore it only before/after a
     complete attempt, and transfer digest-verified assets without writable
     host shares. Add `make check-e2e ARTIFACT_DIR=... SCENARIO=<id>`; refuse
     `VM_IMAGE`. No checkpoint/resume operation is available within a journey.
  4. Provide guest keyboard/mouse graphics and supported read-only observation
     transport. Keep complex assertions in versioned guest scripts/pytest;
     customer actions use the real guest UI. Separate provisioning, observation,
     and declared fault controls so a helper cannot silently set grants,
     preferences, authentication results, session state, or expiry outcomes.
  5. Pass credentials through os-autoinst secret variables and its secret-safe
     password API. Exclude them from screenshots, output, and vars artifacts.
  6. Implement bounded startup, shutdown, interruption, copied-artifact
     collection, and ownership-recorded cleanup. Add guard and cleanup-safety
     regressions, including identity replacement and rejected source disks.
  7. Prove one fresh guest boots, executes a harmless serial command, returns
     evidence, and shuts down. Document console, secret, asset, and helper
     contracts for 19B and later scenarios.
  8. Establish `tests/e2e/scenarios.json` from E2E-Coverage.md with stable scenario
     and variant IDs, category, owner, requirement links, preconditions, ordered
     steps, interventions, assertions, executable references, and expected
     evidence. Future cases remain explicitly pending. Enumerate the coverage
     dimensions before implementing them, using its bounded-matrix rules.
     Establish the minimum versioned evidence fields and safe collector now;
     Task 27 extends them instead of requiring a rewrite of every scenario.
     Future pending entries do not block runner acceptance, but remain required
     for their owning tasks and the final gate.
- Verification:
  - Run cleanup-safety regressions in isolation before starting a guest.
  - Run host-safe guard/refusal tests and the fresh-guest serial smoke.
  - Check baseline/source/host preservation and secret exclusion.
  - Verify runner guards reject in-journey snapshot/checkpoint requests and
    state-writing observation helpers. Inspect the smoke's action trace and
    distinguish outer reset, real machine actions, observations, and cleanup.
  - Run `make check` and `git diff --check`.
- Completion criteria: a guarded outside-guest runner provides working graphical
  and observation transports on the approved VM, owned cleanup, redacted
  artifacts, and the enumerable scenario contract. No backend compatibility
  or customer coverage is claimed without executed evidence.

### Task 19A continuation — 2026-09-07

**Completed boundary:** runtime `evidence.py` and `private_artifacts.py` now
consume the inventory contract. Exact cases, steps, assertions, artifact links,
input identities, timing, split outcomes and cleanup must reconcile before a
pass. Controller-owned failure history preserves the first failure even if a
submitted result clears it. Private copies enforce containment, ownership,
permissions, digests, secret scanning and immutable report filenames. Read the
[runtime contract](../../tests/e2e/README.md#runtime-gate-and-private-collector).
All 33 families / 156 actual variants remain pending. This slice is complete;
19A and customer coverage are not.

**Next result:** wire the guarded distribution/launcher to the qualified worker,
inventory and collector, and expose `check-e2e` through the existing approved
dispatcher. First prove host-safe dispatch/refusal and failure collection; then
run the smallest fresh-boot/harmless-observation smoke with retained private
evidence and owned cleanup. Generate expected provenance independently, record
failures as observed and persist them before risky cleanup. Trusted producers
must exclude PII/authentication captures; secret scanning is not image redaction.
Do not promote the full E2E-001 journey before its 19B matching requirements exist.

**Reuse:** 19P's qualified `generalhw`, API 48, `graphical_worker.py`,
`graphical_lease.py`, `check_graphical_smoke.py`, and F1 provenance conventions.
No backend research, baseline preparation, inventory rewrite or completed
Task 14 rerun is needed. Fresh input transfer, real secret-safe transport,
interruption, source/host preservation and cleanup still need integrated
acceptance; stable screen matching remains 19B.

**Verification:** 244 focused tests passed (142 runtime + 102 inventory), final
pytest time 0.87 s; `git diff --check` passed. Three evolving-code local runs
totaled 2.56 s of pytest; about 15–20 minutes implementation/review/documentation.
[Input digests and scope](Evidence/19A-Runtime-Evidence-20260907.md). No full-suite
or VM acceptance claimed, zero expensive attempts, no blocker or unresolved
diagnosis. Run relevant cleanup prerequisites before any next live operation.

**Next-session settings:** `gpt-5.6-sol` / `high`; model: keep; effort: keep.
**Reason:** inventory and collector boundaries now have focused coverage and the
backend is qualified, so the same model suffices. Integrating lifecycle ownership,
real capture safety and interruption still warrants high effort.

**State:** scope remains this development host and the existing guarded
`ubuntu26.04` VM. All commands exited; no owned operation remains. This session
did not query or change the VM; previous shut-off observations are historical.
Concurrent setup/permission edits were preserved and are outside this slice.

## Task 19B

- Title: Add stable screen matching and graphical smoke.
- Depends on: Task 19A.
- Complexity: medium. This uses the established runner and console contracts.
- Recommended Codex model: `gpt-5.6-terra`
- Recommended reasoning effort: `medium`
- Work:
  1. Add reusable login/GDM, console-switching, and screenshot helpers and initial
     needles. Match small stable regions/text, use explicit click points, and
     exclude clocks and animation instead of matching entire screens.
  2. Add the smoke scenario: boot a fresh product-free guest, recognize GDM,
     switch to serial, execute a harmless command, switch back, record a
     screenshot, and shut down.
  3. Document helper usage, match deadlines, failure artifacts, and exact smoke
     invocation for later scenario tasks.
- Verification:
  - Run cleanup-safety regressions in isolation, then run the graphical smoke
    three consecutive complete qualification attempts, resetting the baseline only
    outside attempts. Mark this `runner-smoke`, not customer acceptance.
    This repetition qualifies the new harness; the ordinary suite runs the
    registered smoke once per attempt, not three times on every invocation.
  - Review screenshots, video, serial output, secret exclusion, and cleanup.
  - Run `make check` and `git diff --check`.
- Completion criteria: stable public-API graphical/serial automation is ready
  for user journeys, without host-window automation, unguarded domain access,
  or VM state shortcuts. Screen/step evidence records actual input and outcomes.
