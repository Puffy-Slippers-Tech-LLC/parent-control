# 172k — Check locking after a temporary interruption

Required tasks: 172c, 172j.
Estimate: 30–60 minutes.
Session exception: keep the finite fault/order, original deadline, recovery and
owned cleanup together on both supported targets.

Use the [shared task contract](../E2E-Execution-Contracts.md#task-brief-contract),
[system acceptance](../E2E-Execution-Contracts.md#system-acceptance), and
[expiry engineering contract](../UI-and-E2E-Coverage.md#expiry-engineering-contract).
Read only the affected current callbacks and shared mechanics, including their
callers, state and cleanup; discover actual selectors in area `session`.

## Scope and acceptance

Exercise a temporarily unavailable native lock action within the original live
desktop. Observe actual protected input, retained work, peer continuity and
bounded supported recovery. Confirm availability and legitimate renewal commit
directly; entitled state must prevent a stale retry. Reuse 172j's observations
without repeating its acknowledgement matrix. Missing retry behavior remains
explicit.

This is installed system qualification, with no customer-case acceptance credit.
Extend the existing system-282 owner only for these missing assertions; reuse
covered mechanics and register the distinct binding once before execution.
Run the affected host checks with explicit timeouts and this installed delta on
`onpc-Ubuntu26.04` and `onpc-Fedora44`. Task completion does not rerun unchanged
predecessor checks or close any canonical customer row.

At [close-out](../E2E-Execution-Contracts.md#completion-and-document-cleanup),
record actual selectors, qualified scope and unresolved limits in the coverage
allocation and owning runtime documentation; advance only this queue row.
