# 141 — Qualify product removal and reinstall commands

Estimate: 30–50 minutes for a focused implementation/validation cycle; not
a stop timer. Follow the [master session contract](../E2E-Execution-Plan.md#execute-one-task).

## Scope and prerequisites

Deliver **LIFE04 product remove/reinstall; LIFE05 corresponding notices/activation**. First scheduled consumer: [E2E-027, case 139](../E2E-Scenario-Recipes.md#e2e-027).
Read the named [block contracts](../E2E-Building-Blocks.md#time-and-ordinary-lifecycle-boundaries) and only the selected consumer's recipe.

Required implemented capabilities (IDs identify master rows; no predecessor brief is needed):

- **007** — LIFE02.
- **079a** — APP02 and FLOW08 native grid/command policy results.
- **014** — FLOW04 kiosk.

Use the catalogue's maintained callables and a fresh attempt, never prior task/VM state.

## Implementation

Bind the exact verified remove and reinstall commands, permitted prompts and
completion/reboot notices. Compose the corresponding LIFE05 notice/reboot path from the qualified LIFE02/GDM07 operations, and keep mechanical file,
account and migration checks under their existing system owners. Purge and
fresh-default observation are a separate capability.

## Live VM acceptance

On the live VM, remove the product through the administrator terminal, read the final reboot-required text, reboot normally and enter the child desktop to use the prepared app. Reinstall, follow the actual activation notice and open Parent. Require affected package cleanup checks and owned cleanup; case 139 owns the complete retained-settings lifecycle.

Run affected safety/adapter checks, then use the complete first consumer if runnable.
Otherwise implement/reuse the planned fixed qualification:

```sh
tools/run-tests integration check_e2e_product_removal
```

This selector must exist under the master's [qualification contract](../E2E-Execution-Plan.md#live-verification-contract)
before invocation. Require every stated result, independent valid entry, wrong-entry
refusal and owned cleanup on the live VM. Host tests and a diagnostic slice do not
establish complete scenario coverage.

## Close out

After live qualification and cleanup, update the callable, exact qualified scope
and status in [E2E-Building-Blocks.md](../E2E-Building-Blocks.md), and reconcile
the first consumer's status in [E2E-Scenario-Recipes.md](../E2E-Scenario-Recipes.md).
A slice alone leaves the full scenario pending. If any complete E2E scenario
passed, run `tools/generate_test_coverage.sh` after that case's cleanup; it runs
`tools/generate_test_coverage.py`. Require successful generation before check-off.

Check this task in the [master](../E2E-Execution-Plan.md), then remove this brief
when its enduring context is in source/contracts and replace its master link
with plain text. Validate changed Markdown with `tools/read-only links`.
Keep normal runner artifacts; no new evidence document or accumulated history.
