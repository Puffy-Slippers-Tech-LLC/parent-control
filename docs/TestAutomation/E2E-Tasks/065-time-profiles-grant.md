# 065 — Compose grant-only and combined time profiles

Estimate: 30–50 minutes for a focused implementation/validation cycle; not
a stop timer. Follow the [master session contract](../E2E-Execution-Plan.md#execute-one-task).

## Read only this context

Use the [scoped reading rules](../E2E-Execution-Plan.md#load-only-the-selected-context).
Read only the named block rows/callables, this recipe's selected cases and
applicable finite-data rows. Prerequisite IDs are completion checks; do not open
their task briefs. Do not load the full queue, catalogue, recipe book or inventory.

## Scope and prerequisites

Deliver **FLOW13 grant-only/combined; retained entry and explicit revoke preparation**. First scheduled consumer: [E2E-010, case 25](../E2E-Scenario-Recipes.md#e2e-010).
Read the named [block contracts](../E2E-Building-Blocks.md#reusable-journey-fragments) and only the selected consumer's recipe.

Required tasks (queue IDs; use delivered scope, not predecessor briefs):

- **051** — FLOW13 daily-only, fresh/same Parent entry with observed G=0.
- **050** — PARENT17, PARENT18.

Use the catalogue's maintained callables and a fresh attempt, never prior task/VM state.

## Implementation

Extend FLOW13 to grant-only and combined/grant-dominant using real kiosk approval followed by retained Parent readback. Keep D/G meanings and elapsed/rounding margins explicit.

## Live VM acceptance

On independent VM attempts, observe D=0/G>0 for grant-only and G>D>0 for the declared combined/grant-dominant preparation. Finish at GDM each time without changing the clock or disabling a live grant. Qualify the explicitly requested revoke-first preparation with PARENT17/18 and fresh PARENT09 readback; an unexpected existing grant without that declared action refuses instead of clearing it silently.

Run affected safety/adapter checks, then implement and register the fixed slice
qualification below in the existing guarded envelope. Run this slice here;
its complete scenario remains a separate queue task:

```sh
tools/run-tests integration check_e2e_time_profiles_grant
```

This selector must exist under the master's [qualification contract](../E2E-Execution-Plan.md#live-verification-contract)
before invocation. Require every stated result, independent valid entry, wrong-entry
refusal and owned cleanup on the live VM. Host tests and a diagnostic slice do not
establish complete scenario coverage.

## Close out

After this slice's live qualification and cleanup, follow the
[master completion contract](../E2E-Execution-Plan.md#completion-and-document-cleanup).
Update the relevant callable/scope/status in
[E2E-Building-Blocks.md](../E2E-Building-Blocks.md) and update the selected recipe only when
its composition changes. Runtime status belongs in the inventory; leave
unfinished scope pending.
Check **065** in the [master's queue](../E2E-Task-Queue.md), update the master's
**Next task** pointer, then delete this brief once its enduring context is maintained
in source/contracts. Validate changed Markdown. Keep normal runner artifacts;
no task archive, evidence document or accumulated history.
