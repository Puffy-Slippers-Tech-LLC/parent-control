# 079a — Observe closure of an already-open native app

Estimate: 20–30 minutes. Aim for one session; this is not a stop timer.
Follow the [session contract](../E2E-Execution-Plan.md#task-size-and-order).

## Session boundary

Add independently observed closure of an earlier captured native activity after saving a block. Reuse 079d's new-launch results and preserve the unaffected target.

Tasks **079d** supply the extracted operations through their maintained
callables and qualified scope. The delivery below is cumulative with those
prerequisites. Implement only the remaining slice above. Keep the original
acceptance results: reuse valid independent-branch evidence, and run every new
composition and any earlier branch affected by the change. No saved VM state or
predecessor brief is an input to this session.

## Read only this context

Use the [scoped reading rules](../E2E-Execution-Plan.md#load-only-the-selected-context).
Read only the named block rows/callables, this recipe's selected cases and
applicable finite-data rows. Prerequisite IDs are completion checks; do not open
their task briefs. Do not load the full queue, catalogue, recipe book or inventory.

## Scope and prerequisites

Deliver **APP02 and FLOW08 native grid/command policy results**. First scheduled consumer: [E2E-005, case 7](../E2E-Scenario-Recipes.md#e2e-005).
Read the named [block contracts](../E2E-Building-Blocks.md#customer-terminal-files-and-application-use), [related block contracts](../E2E-Building-Blocks.md#reusable-journey-fragments) and only the selected consumer's recipe.

Required tasks (queue IDs; use delivered scope, not predecessor briefs):

- **079** — PARENT16 and FLOW03 public app-policy editing.
- **047** — APP04; FLOW08 native usable-app scope.
- **044** — DESK09; FLOW15 and FLOW01 retained scopes.
- **079d** — APP02 and FLOW08 native grid/command blocked-launch results.

Use the catalogue's maintained callables and a fresh attempt, never prior task/VM state.

## Implementation

Qualify native grid/command usable, hidden-launcher, explicit denial and prior-window closure projections. Extend FLOW08 only after APP02 is qualified. A hidden grid entry uses a separately declared command attempt to prove denied execution. APP03 runs only for usable access.

## Live VM acceptance

On the installed VM, open a native activity permissively and capture its public window. Save a block in Parent, return normally and require that earlier window's closure and a denied new launch. Check Allowed, Hard and Soft with no soft exception, plus an unaffected allowed target. Reapplying a block cannot be hidden by relaunching the old activity.

Run affected safety/adapter checks, then implement and register the fixed slice
qualification below in the existing guarded envelope. Run this slice here;
its complete scenario remains a separate queue task:

```sh
tools/run-tests integration check_e2e_observe_native_policy_denial_and_existing_window_closure
```

This selector must exist under the master's [qualification contract](../E2E-Execution-Plan.md#live-verification-contract)
before invocation. Require every stated result, independent valid entry, wrong-entry
refusal and owned cleanup on the live VM. Host tests and a diagnostic slice do not
establish complete scenario coverage.

## Close out

After this slice's live qualification and cleanup, follow the
[master completion contract](../E2E-Execution-Plan.md#completion-and-document-cleanup).
Update the relevant callable/scope/status in
[E2E-Building-Blocks.md](../E2E-Building-Blocks.md) and update the selected recipe only when
its composition changes. Runtime status belongs in the inventory; leave
unfinished scope pending.
Check **079a** in the [master's queue](../E2E-Task-Queue.md), update the master's
**Next task** pointer, then delete this brief once its enduring context is maintained
in source/contracts. Validate changed Markdown. Keep normal runner artifacts;
no task archive, evidence document or accumulated history.
