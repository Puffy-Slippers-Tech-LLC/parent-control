# 196 — Edit and save an open synthetic document

Estimate: 20–30 minutes. Aim for one session; this is not a stop timer.
Follow the [session contract](../E2E-Execution-Plan.md#task-size-and-order).

## Read only this context

Use the [scoped reading rules](../E2E-Execution-Plan.md#load-only-the-selected-context).
Read only the named block rows/callables, this recipe's selected cases and
applicable finite-data rows. Prerequisite IDs are completion checks; do not open
their task briefs. Do not load the full queue, catalogue, recipe book or inventory.

## Scope and prerequisites

Deliver **FILE09**. First scheduled consumer: [E2E-031, case 154](../E2E-Scenario-Recipes.md#e2e-031).
Read the named [block contracts](../E2E-Building-Blocks.md#customer-terminal-files-and-application-use) and only the selected consumer's recipe.

Required tasks (queue IDs; use delivered scope, not predecessor briefs):

- **195** — FILE08.

Use the catalogue's maintained callables and a fresh attempt, never prior task/VM state.

## Implementation

Bind UI16 to the ordinary editor's open synthetic document, then normal Save and public saved/clean-state readback. The existing writable file is an input; do not add Save As or direct filesystem writes.

Use the actual registered editor adapter; qualify document identity, edit, Save and public clean/saved readback separately. Reject wrong-document and uncertain-save input; missing public saved-state evidence blocks completion even when an external ID is available.

## Live VM acceptance

On the VM, open the declared document through FILE08, enter longer synthetic text, Save and read exact text plus saved state. Reopen through normal UI and confirm the content. Missing public saved-state information leaves this binding pending.

Run affected safety/adapter checks, then implement and register the fixed slice
qualification below in the existing guarded envelope. Run this slice here;
its complete scenario remains a separate queue task:

```sh
tools/run-tests integration check_e2e_edit_and_save_an_open_synthetic_document
```

This selector must exist under the master's [qualification contract](../E2E-Execution-Plan.md#live-verification-contract)
before invocation. Require every stated result, independent valid entry, wrong-entry
refusal and owned cleanup on the live VM. Host tests and a diagnostic slice do not
establish complete scenario coverage.

## Close out

After this slice's live qualification and cleanup, follow the
[master completion contract](../E2E-Execution-Plan.md#completion-and-document-cleanup).
Update the relevant callable/scope/status in
[E2E-Building-Blocks.md](../E2E-Building-Blocks.md) and update the selected recipe only when
its composition changes. Runtime status belongs in the inventory; leave
unfinished scope pending.
Check **196** in the [master's queue](../E2E-Task-Queue.md), update the master's
**Next task** pointer, then delete this brief once its enduring context is maintained
in source/contracts. Validate changed Markdown. Keep normal runner artifacts;
no task archive, evidence document or accumulated history.
